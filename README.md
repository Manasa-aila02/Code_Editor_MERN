# CodeAI Studio – AI-Integrated Web-Based Code Editor

CodeAI Studio is a full-stack AI-powered coding platform built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).
It allows users to create folders, manage playgrounds, and write or execute code in multiple programming languages — all within an interactive and intelligent web interface.
An integrated AI assistant provides real-time coding help, making it a smart and efficient environment for developers and learners alike.

## Key Features :

### Folder & Playground Management:
Create and organize folders to neatly group your playgrounds.

### Multi-Language Code Editor:
Write and execute code in multiple programming languages using the Judge0 API.

### Real-Time Code Execution:
Run programs instantly and view input/output directly in the browser.

### Import & Export Functionality:
Easily save, upload, or download your code and I/O files for efficient project management.

### AI Assistant Panel:
Get AI-driven coding guidance, explanations, and problem-solving support directly inside the editor.

### Full-Stack Integration:
Built using React (frontend), Node.js + Express (backend), and MongoDB (database).
